# Alumni Community

 Alumni Project website serves as a platform for interaction and connection between
current and previous students and teachers. Using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, and 
Bootstrap, the website was developed to have a user-friendly interface that is also aesthetically 
pleasing and useful. Alumni and current students can build profiles on the website, network with one 
another, and exchange details about their professional backgrounds and experiences. Students can 
access a wealth of resources, including job postings, career advice, and mentorship opportunities from 
alumni who have excelled in their fields. Teachers can utilize the site to stay in touch with former 
and present students as well as to offer advice and support as they pursue their professional goals. 
Alumni can use the website as a platform to share their knowledge and support the academic 
community.
